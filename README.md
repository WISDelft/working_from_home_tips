# Working from Home 

These are tips for working for home. Everyone is welcome to add tips. First tip: watch this repository, so you receive all new changes.

## Access to Conference Proceedings, Journals and Books 

TU Delft Library has a Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox plugin that can make your life easy. No need for VPN or Sci-hub. 
Find instructions here: [TU Delft Library Access Instructions](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/using-the-library/facilities-study-places/off-campus-access/access-anywhere-with-library-access/)

## Productivity and Focus

- Try out Pomodoro technique, for Mac users Tomato One is a very simple app to help you with that.
- Ignore Corona tweets by adding mute words. Go to: Settings>Content preferences>Safety>Muted>Muted words.
- If you have problems keeping away from social media, a (paid) alternative for computers and phones is [Freedom](https://freedom.to/). Free alternatives include [ColdTurkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/pricing/) and [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/)(Mac Only)
- Making priority list of things-to-do ALWAYS helps to keep on track! Scratch out the ones as you finish them :memo:
- Evernote is great for keeping notes

## Mental (and Physical) Health
- If you're all alone, you need to make an effort to stay in communication with your friends and family. And your colleagues, too! A quick video call can really lift your spirits.
- Go for a walk (while we still can); failing that, do some basic exercises. Take a break and do some push ups, or run on the spot for a few minutes to make your heart beat faster.
- For the fitness enthusiasts, check this [home workout routine](https://youtu.be/-MRNjTr6xrE). :weight_lifting_woman: :weight_lifting_man:
- If you want to exercise but want something gentler there are plenty of yoga videos, including this playlist for ["uncertain times"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFVzpvz0FgQ&list=PLui6Eyny-Uzy-b0MKzL2EfaTqB0ppgK06)
- You need to remember that this is an unprecedented situation. Try not to be too hard on yourself if you're struggling to focus.


## Don't Forget
We are all in this together. Reach out to your colleagues to see how they are doing. And wash those hands!
